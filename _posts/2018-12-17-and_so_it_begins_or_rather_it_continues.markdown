Like other career-switchers in the field, my path towards learning data science was decidedly nonlinear.  Looking back, however, I realize that pursuing a career in data science was the most natural choice given my background. 


In order to understand the arc of my career exploration, we need to go back six years. During my senior year of high school, I did pretty the same thing millions of other seniors do in December: I applied to the "best" schools I felt qualified for because that's what I'd been told to do. Up until that point, I'd felt uncomfortable with the notion that years upon years of traditional schooling were the only path to success, but I hadn't been presented with alternatives so I shoved my misgivings into a dark corner and followed my elders' advice.


When I started college the following year, I still had no idea what I wanted to do. I knew I'd dreamed of traveling and that I liked a challenge, so studying international business in China seemed like a logical decision. To me, international business was a safe career; nothing could go wrong if I chose it. Mandarin was an "exotic" language. Everyone claimed around me claimed it was impossible to learn, so I set out to prove them wrong. 


As it turns out, I did well in microeconomics, but the material didn't speak to me. I know we can't make all our decisions on how strongly things connect to us, but I figured I'd at least explore my options since I still had time. Mandarin is a pretty intuitive language after you learn its foundation, and I enjoyed it. My school didn't have a Chinese language major, so I decided to try out Global China Studies (i.e. broad humanities subjects related to China and East Asia). 


I'm a voracious reader, so I thought a text-heavy course would be a breeze (spoiler alert: it wasn't). Over the course of the semester, reading turned into a chore. I started to dread the sight of books and my library trips dropped to nearly zero. That term, I learned to keep my hobbies and my studies separate.  


By this point, I was running out of time to make a decision. I had one more semester to choose a major. Quickly running through the list (the school was small, there were only around 15 or 20 options), my eyes landed on Interactive Media Arts. I had no idea what that was, but it had something to do with computers and I vaguely remembered tinkering with the CSS in MySpace profile layout codes. It was no longer an active hobby of mine, so jumping into it didn't break my (new) cardinal rule of keeping work life and personal life separate. 


Later, I learned that Interactive Media Arts is about exploring the interaction between humans and computers. It's decidedly more art-based than computer-based, though. It was an enjoyable course but by the end, I didn't feel I had a solid enough set of skills to get a job related to my major. After I graduated, I wound up teaching English in China, which is what I'd been doing part-time throughout my uni years anyway. Once again, I'd made a safe choice. 


The issue, though, is that I truly *did* enjoy working with computers. While I could have probably earned the certificates necessary to teach computer literacy or even basic web development, I decided to stop playing it safe. Though I did learn a lot about my likes and dislikes, playing it safe cost me three college semesters and a year of post-grad self-improvement. I'm 23 years old (as of this writing), I have my entire life ahead of me and there is absolutely no reason for me to live my life according to so-called bulletproof plans. I am in one of the best possible positions to live my best life and (hopefully) help a few people along the way.


When I learned (via Google) about data science, I immediately knew it was what I'd been searching for all along. Data science, in essence, is the art of massaging the information until we can make sense of it.  The process, for me, sounds almost exactly the same as the way I learned Chinese. Learn the parts, see the patterns and create a program for processing the data. For Chinese, the output is literacy, aural comprehension, and oral fluency. With data science, I could take in huge amounts of data and run statistical analyses. Calculus has always been one of my favorite courses, and statistics is a close second. With data science, I could design algorithms or run existing ones to train a machine to discover its own patterns. I could use data science to solve long-standing problems presented by either not having the access to enough samples or by lacking the manpower to handle the data.  


Moreover, data science is not static, as with certain academic fields. It is constantly evolving, which makes it appealing to someone who believes in continuous growth. I get the question "Why data science?" a lot these day. My answer, in short, is that it just makes sense.
